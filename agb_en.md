## §6 Duties and obligations of the consumer, the client

The consumer, the client is responsible for the content of his internet pages or the data sent (matrix messenger, mastodon, email messages). He is obliged to use the services provided by AVENTER properly. This shall also include compliance with the respectively applicable telecommunication law regulations and the observance of the rules of conduct existing on the Internet or in the respective services of the Internet. The consumer, the client undertakes in particular:

(1) Not to use the services provided by AVENTER to violate or incite violations of applicable laws of the Federal Republic of Germany or internationally recognised rules of international law (e.g. incitement of the people, discrimination on the basis of skin colour, race, gender, religion, origin or ideology).

(2) Not to offer or have offered any pornographic content or any services aimed at making a profit which have pornographic and/or erotic content (e.g. nude pictures, peep shows, etc.) as their subject matter. The consumer, the client may not enter his Internet presence in search engines insofar as the use of keywords in the entry violates legal prohibitions, morality and/or the rights of third parties. For each case of violation of the above obligation, the consumer, the client promises to pay a contractual penalty in the amount of 5,100Eruro (in words: five thousand one hundred euros), excluding the assumption of a continuation connection.

(3) Not to send any e-mails containing advertising without the express consent of the respective recipient. This applies in particular if the e-mails in question are distributed en masse, each with the same content (so-called "\spamming").

(4) To label content posted on his Internet site as his own content, stating his full name and address. The consumer, the client is informed that a further legal labelling obligation may exist, e.g. if teleservices or media services are offered on the Internet pages. The consumer, the client shall indemnify AVENTER against all claims of third parties based on a breach of the aforementioned obligations.

(5) In this context, any banners displayed on the web pages of the consumer, the client are also to be understood as use by the consumer, the client.

(6) Patents, trademark rights, copyrights, licensing rights or other property rights of third parties shall be observed. The consumer, the client shall indemnify AVENTER against all claims arising from the use of third party property rights or due to an infringement thereof.

(7) The consumer, the client is obliged to take into account recognised principles of data security, to observe the data protection regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, to keep passwords secret or to change them immediately or to initiate changes if there is a presumption that unauthorised third parties have gained knowledge of them.

(8) The Customer shall also be obliged to inform AVENTER without delay of any disruptions that have occurred, insofar as these affect AVENTER's contractual services and may require AVENTER or third parties commissioned by AVENTER to take measures to remedy the disruption.

(9) The consumer, the client is obliged to create backups of his electronic data at regular intervals. The nextCloud Service offered by AVENTER is not a backup service and does not relieve the consumer, the client of the obligations of a local client backup.

If the consumer, the client violates the obligations mentioned under §6, AVENTER shall be entitled to terminate the contractual relationship without notice in the case of a violation of §6 paragraph (2) and (3) immediately and in the other cases after unsuccessful warning, as well as to block the domain and return it to the responsible NIC organisation.

AVENTER shall not be obliged to check the Internet presence of the consumer, the client for possible infringements of the law. After detecting legal violations or inadmissible content, AVENTER shall be entitled to remove the corresponding Internet pages from the server, block or delete them at any time. AVENTER shall inform the consumer, the client immediately of such a measure. In this case, the consumer, the client shall not be entitled to any claims for damages. AVENTER shall retain the full claim to consideration.

The consumer, the client is entitled to display other companies or goods and services on the web server. However, AVENTER reserves the right to object to such third party presentations if its own interests are affected thereby. Such a collision of interests exists above all when competitors are to be presented. The liability for the third-party presentation shall in any case be assumed by the consumer, the client.



## §7 Domain Registration, Indemnification, Domain Disputes

In the procurement and/or maintenance of Internet domains, AVENTER shall only act as an intermediary in the relationship between the consumer, the client and DENIC or any other organisation for domain allocation. AVENTER has no influence on the allocation of domains. AVENTER therefore does not guarantee that the search for free domains is correct, as this guarantee is already not guaranteed by the operators of the database (that the domains applied for on behalf of the consumer, the client will be allocated at all and/or that allocated domains are free of third-party rights or will last in the long term). The consumer, the client shall indemnify AVENTER against claims for compensation by third parties based on the unauthorised use of an Internet domain by the consumer, the client.

The consumer, the client guarantees that the domain applied for by him does not violate any rights of third parties. The consumer, the client indemnifies AVENTER, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), DENIC and other persons involved in the registration.

Insofar as .com, .net or .org domains are the subject matter of the contract, the consumer, the ordering party, acknowledges that, in accordance with ICANN's guidelines, disputes concerning the domain due to the infringement of trademark, name and other property rights shall be resolved in accordance with the translation of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) provided by means of a link. It is the responsibility of the consumer, the client, to exercise his rights within the framework of proceedings initiated by him or a third party in accordance with the UDRP. The consumer, the client further acknowledges that the licensed registrars are obliged to delete the domain or transfer it to a third party in accordance with a corresponding arbitration award in the proceedings pursuant to the UDRP, unless the consumer, the client proves within 10 days of receipt of the arbitration award that he has brought an action against the prevailing opponent in the arbitration proceedings before a state court regarding the admissibility of the domain.

Insofar as .com, .net or .org domains are the subject matter of the contract, a transfer of the domain by the consumer, the customer to a third party shall be excluded for the duration of court proceedings or arbitration proceedings concerning the domain due to the infringement of trademark, name and other property rights as well as for 15 days beyond the final decision in these proceedings, unless it is ensured that the decision rendered is binding for the third party in the same way as for the consumer, the customer.


## §8 Liability

AVENTER shall only be liable for damages if it has breached a material contractual obligation in a manner endangering the purpose of the contract or if the damage is due to gross negligence or intent (in the event of injury to life, body or health, liability shall apply to intentional or negligent breach of duty). Unless there is intent or gross negligence (or, in the case of injury to life, body or health, negligence), any liability shall be limited to the damage foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract. In all other respects, unless there is intent or gross negligence (or, in the case of injury to life, body or health, also negligence), any liability is excluded, irrespective of the legal grounds. In particular, the exclusion shall also apply to loss of data, loss of profit, other financial losses, consequential harm caused by a defect and indirect consequential harm caused by a defect, unless intent or gross negligence (including negligence in the case of injury to life, body or health) is involved.
